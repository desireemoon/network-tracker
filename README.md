## Project Description

A responsive web application that allows users to create specific social networks and add people to them. Once registered and logged in, the User can create, update, and delete people and networks. The purpose of the app is to give users the ability to keep track of their social circles and the last time they've virtually and physically interacted with the people in their circles.

## Issues and Resolutions
**ERROR**: ActiveRecord::SubclassNotFound: The single-table inheritance mechanism failed to locate the subclass: 'Friends'. This error is raised because the column 'type' is reserved for storing the class in case of inheritance. Please rename this column if you didn't intend it to be used for storing the inheritance class or overwrite Network.inheritance_column to use another column for that information.                             
**RESOLUTION**: Had to change the column name

**ERROR**: with users: { errors: "Nil JSON web token" }
without: This network-tracker.herokuapp.com page canâ€™t be foundNo webpage was found for the web address: https://network-tracker.herokuapp.com/ HTTP ERROR 404                             
**RESOLUTION**: Could not check routes on postman, had to check in app.
